***Creating Project Work Board***
I primarily coordinated with other members of the group in scheduling future tasks for the project, organizing them concisely into the Project work board available on our team's Github page. It currently has the parts completed by Guiller and the current tasks of both myself and Anh.

**Current Task**
My goal that I am working on is to populate the Html view for the various menu options. Currently, Guiller has created html pages for the menu, but they are currently static. It will be much more effective in the future if the program can pull the available options from the database to populate the html on its own.

***Port Over Cybersource***
I ported over the information from the Cybersource lab to the project, which will be invaluable for the verification of credit cards on our system for the Cashier app. Many of the cybersource integration can be used from the lab, but some modifications must be made for the project.

**Current Task**
My goal that I am working on is to populate the Html view for the various menu options. One concern I have is that many tutorials I have analyzed for populating a table with data from the database references php scripts. Hopefully there is a better way to handle this function without php scripts, but I am rather new to using html, so it is taking time to understand it.

***Established Connection to Database to Pull Menu items***
I was able to create an initial shell for connecting to the database and extracting information from its tables to populate the menus. Currently only the connection has been established, but I will continue to update this such that it will populate the html properly. Also created a button that will be used for placing orders on the cashier app.
