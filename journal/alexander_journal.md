***Creating Project Work Board***
I primarily coordinated with other members of the group in scheduling future tasks for the project, organizing them concisely into the Project work board available on our team's Github page. It currently has the parts completed by Guiller and the current tasks of both myself and Anh.

**Current Task**
My goal that I am working on is to populate the Html view for the various menu options. Currently, Guiller has created html pages for the menu, but they are currently static. It will be much more effective in the future if the program can pull the available options from the database to populate the html on its own.
